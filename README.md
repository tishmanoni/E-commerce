#Django E-Commerce Web Application Architecture with Docker, AWS ECS, and ELB

This is an e-commerce web application built with Django and containerized using Docker. The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with a serverless server of Fargate, and the Docker images are pushed to Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The application is also load balanced using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

#Architecture Overview
The architecture of the e-commerce web application consists of the following components:

Django web application: This is the core of the application, built with the Django web framework. The application interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data.
Docker containerization: The Django application is containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile specifies the application's dependencies, configurations, and environment variables.
Elastic Container Registry: The Docker images are pushed to Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to be stored and managed.
Elastic Container Service: The web application is deployed on Elastic Container Service (ECS) with a serverless server of Fargate, which provides automatic scaling, load balancing, and server management.
Elastic Load Balancer: The web application is load balanced using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), which distributes incoming traffic across the ECS containers.
